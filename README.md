# TradeMartServer

This will serve as the backend server for our SOFTENG2 project.


## Building
to build the project, just use the wrapper gradle file:

on Linux:
```
./gradlew build
```

on Windows:
```
gradle.bat build
```

## Running 
Since this project uses gradle, It would be much easier to run the project
through the gradle wrapper script.

on Linux:
```
./gradlew run
```

on Windows:
```
gradle.bat run
```
